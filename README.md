## Neural Network Model Report
The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that can predict the success of non-profit organizations funded by Alphabet Soup.
Target Variable:

The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL. This is a binary variable that indicates whether an organization was successful (1) or not (0).
Feature Variables:

The feature variables include:
APPLICATION_TYPE
AFFILIATION
CLASSIFICATION
USE_CASE
ORGANIZATION
STATUS
INCOME_AMT
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
ASK_AMT
Removed Variables:

The columns EIN (Employer Identification Number) and NAME were removed from the input data as they are unique identifiers and do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

## Training Accuracy: 74.14%
## Validation Accuracy: 72.30%
## Training Loss: 0.5316
## Validation Loss: 0.6003

The deep learning model created for predicting the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup performed reasonably well, achieving around 74.14% accuracy but falling short of the 75% target. 
Several optimizations were attempted, including adjusting the architecture of the neural network and refining the input data, but the desired performance was not reached.

Recommendation for Improvement:
To further improve the performance of the classification task, other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be considered. Additionally, using ensemble methods could 
improve predictive power by combining the strengths of different models to achieve better results.
